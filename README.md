# Security_Vulns
Application that displays sample "Security Scan" data in a grid using HTML5, Javascript, CSS3, and AngularJS.

To run the application, load the file Security_Vulns/WebSite/ScanResults.html into a browser (IE11 or the latest Google Chrome, 
tested in IE11 and Chrome v58 for 64-bit Windows 7).

To select a vulnerability and view more detail, click on the checkbox at the beginning of the grid row for that vulnerability.
When a vulnerability is selected, additional detailed information and links will appear in the box below the grid.

The grid columns are sortable.  To sort, click on the down arrow ("v") at the right of each column header, and select "Sort Ascending" 
or "Sort Descending."  

There is also an option in the column sort menu to hide a column.  To get "hidden" columns back, simply refresh the page.

Enjoy using the application!
